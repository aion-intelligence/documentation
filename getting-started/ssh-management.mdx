#### Step 1: Open the SSH Keys page

In the left sidebar, navigate to `Management → SSH`. SSH keys enable secure access to your GPU instances.

#### Step 2: Start adding a new SSH key

Click the green `Add SSH Key +` button (top-right).

#### Step 3: Get your SSH public key from your local machine

You'll paste your **public** key (a `.pub` file) into the `SSH Key` field.

`To find your public key:`

1. List SSH keys on your terminal:

```bash
ls -al ~/.ssh
````

2. Look for a file ending in `.pub` (for example: `id_rsa.pub` or `id_ed25519.pub`).
3. Print the key to your terminal (example using RSA):

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

4. Copy the entire output (it usually starts with something like `ssh-rsa` or `ssh-ed25519`).

> `Important:` Paste the full line exactly as shown (no extra spaces or line breaks).
>
> `Tip:` If you don’t have a `.pub` file yet, you can generate one with:
>
> ```bash
> ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email"
> ```
>
> Press Enter to accept the defaults, then re-run the commands above to copy your new public key.

`To upload the key in AION:`

1. Paste your public key into the `SSH Key` field.
2. Enter a recognizable `Key Name` (for example: your laptop name).
3. Click `Add SSH Key`.

#### Step 4: Verify the key is added

Once saved, your key appears in the SSH Keys list.

You can now select this key during GPU instance creation from the `SSH Key` dropdown.

#### Optional: Delete an SSH key

> `Warning:` Deleting an SSH key is permanent and cannot be undone.

1. In the SSH Keys list, click `Delete` on the key you want to remove.
2. In the confirmation dialog, type the exact key name shown.
3. Click `I understand the consequences. DELETE this resource`.
