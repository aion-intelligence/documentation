#### Step 1: Open the Kubernetes page

Start by navigating to AION and opening the Kubernetes console.

1. In the left navigation, click `Kubernetes` (under `Home`).
2. The Kubernetes page shows a world map and region cards with available GPU clusters, GPU types, and pricing.

You will see cards for each region describing GPU type, availability, RAM, interconnect and price.

#### Step 2: Choose a region / cluster and provision

1. Browse the available region cards and the interactive map. Each card displays:
    - `GPU type` (H100, H200, etc.)
    - `Availability`
    - `RAM` / `Interconnect` / `Storage`
    - `Price per hour`
2. Select the region / cluster that matches your GPU, memory, and price requirements.
3. Click `Provision` on the card for the region/cluster you want to deploy.

After you click `Provision`, you will move to the project selection step.

#### Step 3: Create or select a project

You must either pick an existing project or create a new one before launching a cluster.

1. On the Project step, either choose `Existing Projects` or expand `Create New Project`.
2. If creating a new project, fill in:
    - `Project Name` (required)
    - `Project Description` (optional)
3. Click `Next` to proceed to the cluster configuration step.

Your project will appear in the project dropdown when creating or managing clusters.

#### Step 4: Configure the cluster and launch

Define the cluster configuration and launch it.

1. Fill the cluster configuration fields shown in the UI:
    - `Cluster Name`: A friendly name such as `myfirstk8s`
    - `Nodes`: Use the **– / +** controls to set the number of nodes
    - `Image`: Select a base image (for deep learning stacks this may include PyTorch/CUDA)
    - `SSH Key`: Select the public key you uploaded earlier
    - `Kubernetes Version`: Choose the desired K8s version
    - `CNI Plugin`, `Pod CIDR`, `Service CIDR` and other network fields
2. Review the **Estimated total cost** shown in the summary panel on the right.
3. Click the green `Launch` button to create the cluster.

The cluster will show a status such as `Initializing` while nodes come up.

#### Step 5: Retrieve the Kubeconfig command

Once the cluster is created it will appear in the `Current cluster` section.

1. Open the cluster details from the Current cluster list.
2. Click `KubeConfig` (or the KubeConfig button). A dialog appears containing a command you can run from your workstation to print the admin kubeconfig.

The dialog contains a command resembling:

```bash
ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i <path-to-your-ssh-private-key> ubuntu@k8s-<cluster-id>.groundcontrol-aion.xyz sudo cat /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf
```

Click `Copy command` or copy the command manually.

> `Important:` Use the exact host and user shown in the dialog. Replace `<path-to-your-ssh-private-key>` with the path to your private key on your workstation.

#### Step 6: Save the kubeconfig locally and connect with kubectl

Run the SSH command (copied in Step 5) locally and redirect the output to a file to save the admin kubeconfig.

```bash
# Replace the key path and host with the values from the UI
ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa ubuntu@k8s-<cluster-id>.groundcontrol-aion.xyz 'sudo cat /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf' > ~/kubeconfig.yaml
```

Now use the kubeconfig with `kubectl`:

```bash
# Temporarily use the kubeconfig for the current shell
export KUBECONFIG=~/kubeconfig.yaml
kubectl get nodes

# Or reference directly without exporting
kubectl --kubeconfig=~/kubeconfig.yaml get nodes
```


#### Step 7: (Optional) SSH into a node

If you need to debug at the node level:
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa ubuntu@<INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP>
```

Important: Always keep your private SSH key secure. Use chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa to set correct permissions. Do not share your private key.
