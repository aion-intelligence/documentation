## Instance is not getting created, what should I do?
If an instance fails to create, it’s usually caused by **capacity**, **configuration**, or **billing/wallet** issues.

**Try the following:**
- Confirm your **wallet balance** has enough funds (Billing & Usage → Overview).
- Double-check your selected **region**, **instance type**, and **GPU category**.
- Try creating the instance with a **smaller GPU/shape** or a different configuration.
- If the UI shows an error message, copy it and include it in your support request.

**If it still fails:** contact **Support** with all the details.


## My instance is stuck (creating/starting/stopping/deleting). What can I do?
A stuck instance is usually waiting on underlying capacity, networking, or a pending action. 
You can try to Refresh the page and check the updated status. Or contact Support team.


## My instance IP is not working, what should I check?
To connect to your instance, first confirm the instance is in a **Running** state and that you are using the IP shown in the instance card. Make sure you are connecting with the **same SSH key** that you added on the platform and selected during instance creation, 
and use the correct username. Also ensure your local network or firewall allows outbound connections to the instance.

If the IP is still unreachable or SSH continues to fail, contact Support team.


## SSH is not working, how do I troubleshoot?
SSH failures are usually caused by a wrong key, username, network rules, or connecting to the wrong IP.

**Try the following:**
- Confirm you are using the **correct public IP** for the instance.
- Confirm you are using the **correct SSH key** that was associated with the instance.
- Confirm you are using the correct **SSH username** for your OS image (varies by image).
- Ensure your network/firewall rules allow **TCP port 22** from your IP.
- Try SSH in verbose mode to see what fails:
  - `ssh -vvv -i /path/to/key user@<instance-ip>`

**If the instance was created without the correct key:** you may need to recreate it with the correct SSH key.



## My instance won’t delete, what should I do?
If deletion is stuck, it may be blocked by a pending operation or backend cleanup.
Also you can refresh the console and re-check the instance state. If it remains stuck, you can contact the Support team.


## “Availability not present" what does it mean?
This usually means there is **no capacity available** for the selected resource in that region at the moment.

**What you can do:**
- Try a different **GPU type/size**.
- Try a different **region** (if available to your account).
- Retry later, as capacity can change.

If you need guaranteed capacity, contact Support to discuss options.



## “GPU category not present”, what does it mean?
This indicates the selected GPU category is **not currently available** in the selected region.

**What you can do:**
- Change the **region** and check again.
- Choose a different GPU.
- Contact Support if you need a particular GPU for your organization.


## How do I manage SSH keys (maintenance and bookkeeping)?
You can manage keys from the console under:
**Management → SSH**

**Best practices:**
- Give keys clear names (for example: `alice-macbook-2026`, `ci-deploy-key`).
- Remove old or unused keys to reduce risk.
- Rotate keys periodically (add the new key first, then remove the old one).
- Keep a secure backup of private keys—private keys cannot be recovered if lost.
- Track which key is used by which project/team to avoid access issues later.
