## Where can I see my notifications?
You can view notifications from the bell icon in the top-right corner of the console. The badge count shows how many unread notifications you have, and opening the bell will show the latest updates (such as invitations and account-related events).

## How do invitations work?
Invitations are used to grant access to an organization, team, or project. When someone invites you, you will receive an invitation to join, and once you accept it, your access is enabled based on the role and permissions assigned to you.

## How do I invite someone to my organization/team?
Go to **Management → Teams** and send an invitation to the user’s email address. The invited user will be able to join after accepting the invitation, and their access will follow the role/permissions you assign.

## I didn’t receive an invitation email. What should I do?
First, confirm the invitation was sent to the correct email address. Then check your spam/junk folder and make sure your email provider isn’t blocking automated emails. If you still don’t see it, ask the inviter to send the invitation again. If the user already has access to the console, they should also check the notification bell for any pending invitation or access update.

## My invitation link is expired or not working. What should I do?
Invitation links can expire for security reasons. Ask the team/admin to send a new invitation, then use the latest link to accept and join.

## I accepted the invitation, but I still can’t see the project or resources. Why?
Access depends on the role and the scope you were added to. In some cases, you may be added to an organization/team but not yet added to the specific project, or your role may not include permissions for that resource. Ask your admin to confirm your team/project membership and role, then refresh the console or sign out and sign back in.

## Can I accept an invitation with a different email than the one that was invited?
No. You need to accept the invitation using the same email address that received the invite. If you want to use a different email, ask the admin to invite the new email instead.

## I accidentally declined an invitation. Can I get it back?
Yes. Ask the admin/team owner to send the invitation again. Accepting the new invitation will restore access based on the assigned role.

## Can an admin resend an invitation?
Yes. If the invited user didn’t receive the invite or the link expired, the admin can send a fresh invitation from **Management → Teams**.

## Do you send notifications by email?
Invitations are typically delivered through email so users can join the organization/team. Other product notifications are available inside the console via the notification bell. If you need a specific notification to be delivered by email, contact Support.

## Will invoices be sent by email as notifications?
Not right now. Invoices are not emailed currently, and you can download them from **Billing & Usage → Invoices**.

## Who should I contact if invitations or notifications are not working?
If invitations are not being delivered, links fail repeatedly, or notifications don’t appear in the console, contact Support from the **Support** button in the top bar and include the invited email address, your organization/team name, and a screenshot of any error.
