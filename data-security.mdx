## Data locality and residency

Customer data (including content and associated metadata) is stored and processed within the region(s) selected for the tenant/workspace.
The service is designed to avoid moving customer data outside the selected region unless explicitly configured or required for operations.

Backups and disaster recovery are configured to meet availability objectives.

## Encryption, key management, and rotation

Data in transit is protected using TLS. Data at rest is encrypted using envelope encryption, where data keys are protected by a key-encryption key managed by the underlying cloud or infrastructure provider.

Key management is handled through the provider’s key-management service (KMS or equivalent). The provider maintains secure key storage and rotates underlying key material according to its standard practices. 
Where customer-managed keys are supported, rotation frequency and ownership can be configured based on customer policy.


## Authentication controls and 2FA status

Administrative access is governed through RBAC and least privilege, with periodic access reviews and centralized logging of administrative activity.

As of January 2026, two-factor authentication (2FA) is not enabled. In this state, account security relies on single-factor credentials, so access is tightly scoped and monitored and compensating controls are applied (for example, strong password policy and alerting for anomalous sign-in activity). 
A remediation plan to enable and enforce 2FA is maintained with an owner and target timeline.

## Compliance and assurance

The security program is designed to align with commonly requested frameworks (for example, SOC 2, ISO 27001, and privacy requirements such as GDPR) based on the organization’s obligations. 


## Production access governance

Engineers do not have direct access to production systems. Production operations are executed through controlled automation (CI/CD and infrastructure-as-code) with peer review, approvals, and audit logging.

Operational access to production, where required, is restricted to a small set of platform or operations roles, granted on a least-privilege basis, time-bounded where supported, and continuously logged.

## No break-glass access

The service does not maintain break-glass accounts or an emergency bypass mechanism that would allow personnel to circumvent standard controls.
Urgent response is coordinated through documented incident procedures and automation, and elevated actions follow standard approval and audit expectations.
